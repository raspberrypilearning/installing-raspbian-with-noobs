## Writing NOOBS to an SD Card: Which OS?

If the SD card you wish to install Raspbian on currently has an older version of Raspbian, you may wish to back up the files from the card.

To install Raspbian, you're going to need a computer. Depending on the operating system you are using, the setup instructions will be slightly different. To make things simple, this resource assumes that you are using either Microsoft Windows 10 or Apple OS X El Capitan. If you are using one of the many flavours of GNU/Linux, or if you are a technically proficient user of another OS, then you're probably more than capable of installing Raspbian yourself, but you might want to check out the guides [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).

If you are using an earlier version of one of the operating systems, then you should be able to follow the instructions, although some of the screenshots will look a little different.
